## Overview
### Description
4/5ths of Americans consume media from both sides of the political spectrum. Suppose an event 
happens and a person wants to get information from both CNN and Fox news. They would have to search 
up the news story on each news outletâ€™s respective website and find an appropriate article for each.
 The most popular news aggregators (Feedly, Google News, Morning News, etc) do not have a function 
 in order to streamline this process. Dipole News App fills this niche.
